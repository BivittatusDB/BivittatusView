# BivittausView
This the source code for a gui viewer of data in pydb file, made in the [BivittatusDB](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/BivittatusDB) repository. While not much has been done here, due to lack of skills on my part, I'm hoping somebody could be inspired to help out.

## The Vision
I don't have much of an idea of what is needed here, but I think it should include three things:
1. A menubar to access/update files
2. A database tree to open tables
3. A table viewer
4. A python emulator where the table can be updated using code

## Notes
* I've included some files that are likely necissary for creation of the code including the database handler code and encryption code, but more source code from [BivittatusDB](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/BivittatusDB) may be needed. 
* The files are triple encrypted by user request, so a way of checking if encrypted will likely be needed. 
* Soon Files will be compressed before encryption as well, so that may be needed as well.
* A database file can be created using the source code of [BivittatusDB](https://github.com/HarbingerOfFire/BivittatusDB)
